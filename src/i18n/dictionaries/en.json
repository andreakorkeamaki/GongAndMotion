    "what_is_qigong_content": "In our modern lives, many of us spend much of our time in our thoughts, often feeling disconnected from our deeper selves and from the world around us. Qigong offers a way backâ€”a path to reconnection. This gentle, meditative practice has been used for thousands of years to harmonise body, mind, and spirit.<br/><br/>Qigong's true origins stretch far back into ancient China, beyond the reach of clear historical records. While documented references date back around 2,500 years, Chinese historians and archaeologists have found evidence of similar practices as far back as 5,000 years ago.<br/><br/>Over the centuries, Qigong has been known by many names. One of the earliest was Dao Yin, meaning \"guiding and leading the energy.\" The term Qigong itself did not come into common use until the twentieth century.<br/><br/>At its heart, Qigong encourages us to slow down, become present, and reconnectâ€”with ourselves, with others, and with nature. Through regular practice, we begin to move in rhythm with life, cultivating a sense of balance, awareness, and vitality. More than just an exercise, Qigong is a living tradition that supports well-being on every level.",

During treatment, the therapist uses a stethoscope to follow the intestines' activity â€” showing how the body processes and releases stress.<br/><br/>Developed by Gerda Boyesen, a pioneer of modern body-oriented psychotherapy, this method recognises that unresolved emotions can remain in the body and block the natural flow of life energy. Through biodynamic massage and psychotherapy, these blockages can be released, allowing more vitality, calm, and balance.",
